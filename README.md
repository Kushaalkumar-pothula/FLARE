# FLARE
FLARE is an astrophysical code written in python to generate a synthetic catalog of 100,000 Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). It employs a Monte-Carlo algorithm to generate synthetic FRBs.

## Installation 
To install FLARE on a computer, run the following commands in your terminal:
```bash
mkdir FLARE
cd FLARE
git clone https://github.com/Kushaalkumar-pothula/FLARE.git
cd FLARE
```
Now you should have the FLARE code successfully installed on your machine.

## Usage
To generate a synthetic FRB catalog using FLARE, you will need to run ```gen.sh```, which can be done by running the following commands in terminal:
```bash
chmod +x gen.sh
./gen.sh
```
You will now find some ```.txt``` files, which have the local date-time (during the catalog generation) as a prefix.
